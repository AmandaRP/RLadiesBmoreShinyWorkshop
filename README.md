# R Ladies Baltimore: Shiny Workshop

Starter code can be found in the shinyApp and shinyDashboard directories. The first contains code to create a shiny app. The second contains code to create a shiny dashboard. 

We're using data related to the Australian wildfires. The wildfires.R script is used by both apps to read, wrangle, and clean the data.

Complete versions of the app can be found here:
* [shiny app](https://amandarp.shinyapps.io/AustralianWildfiresApp/) 
* [shiny dashboard app](https://amandarp.shinyapps.io/AustralianWildfiresDashboard/)
